# Rails Credentials Template - kanban-rails
# =============================================================================
#
# This file documents every credential key used by the application.
# Use it as a checklist when setting up a new environment.
#
# To edit credentials for an environment:
#   rails credentials:edit --environment development
#   rails credentials:edit --environment test
#   rails credentials:edit --environment production
#
# Each environment has its own .yml.enc and .key file.
# Keys are stored in 1Password (ClawdBot vault).
# Production key is MechDog-only (HIPAA compliance).
#
